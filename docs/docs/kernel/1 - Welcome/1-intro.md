The package provides a robust foundation for creating scalable (micro-)services applications.

It features a modular architecture, leveraging dependency injection for managing application components, and supporting middleware for handling HTTP requests and responses.

The package is designed to promote clean, maintainable code and facilitate easy integration of additional functionality, making it ideal for building both simple and complex services.

This package combines [koa](https://koajs.com/) as http server with [awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix) for pollution free dependency injection.
