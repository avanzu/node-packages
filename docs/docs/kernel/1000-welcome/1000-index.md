The `@avanzu/kernel` package provides a modular foundation for backend applications using [Koa](https://koajs.com/) and [Awilix](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix).

It handles:

- Application lifecycle
- Middleware bootstrapping
- Dependency injection container wiring
- Container module support

> It's built to stay out of your way. If you want to plug in your own concepts — it won’t stop you.
